# Two-Player Chess Game with Dynamic Resizing and Game State Saving

## Description
A Python-based two-player chess game developed using Pygame. This project enhances an existing implementation by adding dynamic board resizing and a save/load game state feature, improving both usability and functionality.

## Inspiration and References
This project was inspired by the open-source repository:
- [CraftyGPT/Simple-Python-Chess](https://github.com/CraftyGPT/Simple-Python-Chess.git)

The file `original.py` and chess piece images were referenced and adapted from this repository to form the foundation of the game.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Board Resizing**: Automatically adjusts the chessboard size to match the screen resolution.
- **Save and Load Game State**: Allows players to pause the game and resume later without losing progress.
- **Rule-Compliant Moves**: Includes comprehensive move validation for all chess pieces.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Supports alternating moves between two players.
- **Undo Feature**: Enables players to reverse their last move for better gameplay experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Game Library**: Pygame, Pygame GUI
- **Development Approach**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
